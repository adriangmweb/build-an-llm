# Build an LLM

A project for building and understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) from scratch, following Sebastian Raschka's book on LLM development.

## Description

This educational project aims to provide hands-on experience in building and understanding Large Language Models. By following Sebastian Raschka's book, we explore the fundamental concepts, architecture, and implementation details of LLMs.

## Project Status

The project currently contains:

- Chapter 2: Tokenization and embeddings
- Chapter 3: Attention mechanisms and transformers
- Chapter 4: Building a GPT model from scratch
- Chapter 5: Training and fine-tuning LLMs

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of deep learning concepts
- Familiarity with PyTorch or similar deep learning frameworks

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/build-an-llm.git
cd build-an-llm
```
